# Hello-Again
re-learning github after a long hiatus
Hi I am a qa tester but I am learning to develop stuff on my own. 
Ever have that experience where you are stumped by a problem, you are frustrated, your mind is drawing a blank, then you lean back for a second, then all of a sudden out of nowhere the solution pops into your head? I don't remember experiencing that until I started coding. Before, when faced with a problem, there was always a long arduous process that I was well aware of until finally clawing my way to an "Aha!" moment. But this is different. It's more like try-fail-try-fail...still trying - still failing - have no idea - ready to give up - wonder what's for dinner - think about that report that is due at work tomorr  - BOOM - complex solution right there front of brain.
